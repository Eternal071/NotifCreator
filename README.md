# NotifCreator
Simple notification creator straight from the terminal.

_________________________________________________________
Notes -

* Change all of the "prompt" variables (Eg. tprompt, iprompt) to strings and enter what you desire if you want it to send the same notification each time.
* If any errors occur (Eg. window immediately closes after start) run it from the command line.
